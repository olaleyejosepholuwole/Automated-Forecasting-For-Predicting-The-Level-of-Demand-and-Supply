Automated Forecasting For Predicting The Level of Demand and Supply
Forecasting is the process of making predictions based on past and present data. Later these can be
compared (resolved) against what happens. For example, a company might estimate their revenue in the
next year, then compare it against the actual results. Prediction is a similar, but more general term.
Forecasting might refer to specific formal statistical methods employing time series, cross-sectional or
longitudinal data, or alternatively to less formal judgmental methods or the process of prediction and
resolution itself. Usage can differ between areas of application: for example, in hydrology the terms
"forecast" and "forecasting" are sometimes reserved for estimates of values at certain specific future times,
while the term "prediction" is used for more general estimates, such as the number of times floods will
occur over a long period.
Risk and uncertainty are central to forecasting and prediction; it is generally considered good practice to
indicate the degree of uncertainty attached to forecasts. In any case, the data must be up to date in order for
the forecast to be as accurate as possible. In some cases, the data used to predict the variable of interest is
itself forecast.
This project is an implementation of a highly sophisticated and high-performance automated forecasting model suitable for the following markets


[12] Forecasting has application in many situations:
Supply chain management - This model is highly recommended and can be used in supply chain management to
ensure that the right product is at the right place at the right time. Accurate forecasting will
help retailers reduce excess inventory and thus increase profit margin., it boasts of an array of some of the finest  Tech-Industry's highly sought after forecasting methods such as the Exponential smoothing state-space model, Auto-regressive Integrated moving Average Models, Auto-regressive neural networks amongst others alongside a Hybrid of the standard metrics for building forecasting applications such as the Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error,  Root Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Squared Error. Without boring my readers with too many details, a pdf reference guide  and material is provided   and  have shown
that extrapolations are the least accurate, while company earnings forecasts are the most
reliable.
Accurate forecasting will also help them meet consumer demand.
